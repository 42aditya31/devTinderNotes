We are going to learn Node js thorugh out the making a realworld project , so you can understand the concepts better and also you will be able to build your own project using Node js.
So, make notes regarding the concepts we are going to learn, so you can refer them later when you will be building your own project.
This is the project Intro file :
- Project Name: DevTinder
- Project Description: DevTinder is a platform where developers can meet, connect, and collaborate on projects together. It aims to facilitate networking and project development among developers.
- Project Goal: The goal of this project is to create a fully functional web application that allows developers to create profiles, connect with other developers, and collaborate on projects. The application will be built using Node.js for the backend and React.js for the frontend.
- What we going to build:
- we will make using the microservices architecture, where we will have different services Each service will be responsible for a specific functionality and will communicate with each other through APIs.
1. Frontend Service(React Js): This service will handle the user interface and user interactions. It will be built using React.js.
2. Backend Service(Node Js): This service will handle the business logic and data processing. It will be

- what do you mean by Waterfall Model:
- Requirements(Project Manager + help of designer) --> Design(Senior Engineer/ Tech lead ) --> Development(SDE1, SDE2) --> Testing(SDET) ---> Deployment(DevOps + dev team ) --> Maintainance (whole cycle agian )

- what do mean by monolith vs microservices:
- Monolith: A single, unified application where all components are interconnected and interdependent.   
- Microservices: An architectural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services, each responsible for a specific business capability. Each service can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.

Monolith vs Microservices:
- Monolith:
  - Single codebase
  - Tight coupling of components
  - Easier to develop and deploy initially
  - Easier to develop initially
  - Harder to scale and maintain as it grows
  - Deployment requires the entire application to be redeployed
- Microservices:
  - Multiple codebases, each for a service
  - Loose coupling of components
  - More complex to develop initially
  - Easier to scale and maintain as each service can be managed independently
  - Deployment can be done for individual services without affecting the entire application

-Explain all the parameters what happend in the monolith vs microservices:
- Dev speed, Code Repo , Scalability, Deployment, Team Structure, Testing, Maintainability, Performance, Technology Stack, Communication, Fault Isolation, Infra Cost, Complexity, Ownership, Rewamps, debugging , dev experience.
